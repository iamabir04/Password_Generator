## Security Considerations
<ul>
  <li>The web app uses the built-in JavaScript Math.random() method to generate random passwords, which should be sufficient for most use cases. However, if you require even higher security, consider using a more specialized library for random number generation.</li>
  <li>The web app runs entirely on the client-side (in the user's browser). No data is transmitted or stored on a server. Nevertheless, it's always good practice to use this app on a secure and trusted machine.</li>
  <li>Be cautious when using generated passwords on public or shared computers. Always remember to log out and clear any saved passwords from the browser's cache after use.</li>
</ul>
